#write a function called linear_search_product that takes the listof products and a target product name as input.the function should perform a linear search to find the target product in the list and return a list of indices of all occurences of the product if found,or an empty list if the product is not  found.



def linearsearchproduct(productlist, targetproduct):
  indices = []

  for index, product in enumerate(productlist):
    if product == targetproduct:
      indices.append(index)

  return indices


#example usage:
products = ["shoes","boot","loafer","shoes","sandal","shoes"]
target = "shoes"
target2 = 'apple'
result = linearsearchproduct(products, target)
print(result)
